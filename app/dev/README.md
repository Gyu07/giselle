# /dev Directory

This directory serves as a dedicated space for technical validation within our Next.js application using the App Router.

## Purpose

- A designated area for placing pages and code intended for technical validation
- A sandbox for testing new ideas and experimental features
- An environment for free development without affecting production code

## Guidelines

1. **Maintain Independence**
   - Code in this directory should minimize dependencies on code in other directories under `/app`.
   - Implement modules and components as independently as possible.

2. **Code Quality**
   - As the main purpose of this directory is technical validation, code here doesn't need to be as strict as regular production code.
   - It's acceptable to use arbitrary variable names or `any` types.
   - The priority is "making it work".

3. **Reusability**
   - Code in this directory is not intended to be used as-is in a production environment.
   - If incorporating validated techniques into production code, always refactor appropriately.

4. **Documentation**
   - It's recommended to leave brief explanations or comments for each validation item or test case.
   - Document important findings or conclusions to aid future reference and understanding by other developers.

## Precautions

- Ensure that code in this directory is not deployed to the production environment.
- Regularly clean up obsolete code and files to prevent directory bloat.

Let's effectively utilize this directory to promote innovation and experimentation!
